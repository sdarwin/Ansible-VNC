### You should configure vnc_users for your list of users. Give each a different vnc_num.
# vnc_users:
#   - username: 'ubuntu'
#     usergroup: 'ubuntu'     # usergroup is optional. Defaults to username.
#     #port 5901 is 1
#     vnc_num: 1
#     vnc_default_password: mypassword
#   - username: 'john'
#     #port 5902 is 2
#     vnc_num: 2
#     vnc_default_password: mypassword
#     vnc_client_options_per_user: "-localhost"
#   - username: 'paul'
#     #port 5903 is 3
#     vnc_num: 3
#     vnc_default_password: mypassword
#   - username: 'george'
#     #port 5904 is 4
#     vnc_num: 4
#     vnc_default_password: mypassword
#   - username: 'ringo'
#     #port 5905 is 5
#     vnc_num: 5
#     vnc_default_password: mypassword

### Choices are "gnome" and "xfce4"
vnc_desktop: gnome
# vnc_desktop: xfce4

### Choices of vnc_server for Ubuntu/Debian are currently "tigervnc", "vnc4server" and "tightvnc".
### For Redhat/CentOS, only "tigervnc".
### Some default choices have already been set in the vars/ folder

# vnc_server: tigervnc

# when vnc_paradigm == "version1" ...
vnc_client_options: "-geometry 1600x1200 -localhost"

# when vnc_paradigm == "version2" ...
vnc_config_options:
  - "geometry=1600x1200"
  - "localhost"

### Should the role generate and enable per-user systemd services for VNC desktops?
vnc_install_systemd_services: false

### Add the vncstart.sh script to users' .bashrc for vnc autostart when logging in? Recommended.
vnc_bashrc_startup: true

### Ansible will create certain scripts such as ~/.config/systemd/user/vncserver.service and ~/vncstart.sh
### The question is should Ansible overwrite them later on? Set this to True or False.
vnc_ansible_managed_startup_scripts: false

### Ansible will create xstartup. The question is should Ansible overwrite xstartup files later on? Set this to True or False.
vnc_ansible_managed_xstartup: false

### Ansible will create .vnc/config. The question is should Ansible overwrite .vnc/config later on? Set this to True or False.
vnc_ansible_managed_config: false

### It has been discovered that an Ubuntu server, in the Cloud, ought to be rebooted at least one time in order to fix the locale settings.
### If you set this to True, then Ansible will reboot the server. The default here is False, so you will need to reboot manually.
### Only affects the systemd type configuration, otherwise not relevant.
vnc_reboot_once: false
