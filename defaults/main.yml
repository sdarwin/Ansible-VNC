### You should configure vnc_users for your list of users. Give each a different vnc_num.
# vnc_users:
#   - username: 'ubuntu'
#     usergroup: 'ubuntu'     # usergroup is optional. Defaults to username.
#     #port 5901 is 1
#     vnc_num: 1
#     vnc_default_password: mypassword
#   - username: 'john'
#     #port 5902 is 2
#     vnc_num: 2
#     vnc_default_password: mypassword
#     vnc_server_options_per_user: "-localhost"
#   - username: 'paul'
#     #port 5903 is 3
#     vnc_num: 3
#     vnc_default_password: mypassword
#   - username: 'george'
#     #port 5904 is 4
#     vnc_num: 4
#     vnc_default_password: mypassword
#   - username: 'ringo'
#     #port 5905 is 5
#     vnc_num: 5
#     vnc_default_password: mypassword

### Choices are "gnome" and "xfce4"
vnc_desktop: gnome
# vnc_desktop: xfce4

### Choices of vnc_server for Ubuntu/Debian are currently "tigervnc", "vnc4server" and "tightvnc".
### For Redhat/CentOS, only "tigervnc".
### Some default choices have already been set in the vars/ folder

# vnc_server: tigervnc

# Used with older vnc servers.
vnc_server_options: "-geometry 1920x1200 -localhost"

# Used by this role on newer tiger vnc servers.
vnc_config_options:
  - "geometry=1920x1200"
  - "localhost"

### Should the role generate and enable per-user systemd services for VNC desktops?
### This variable refers to a previous implementation of per-user systemd, before the newer TigerVNC update, where standard systemd is used.
vnc_install_systemd_services: false

### Add the vncstart.sh script to users' .bashrc for vnc autostart when logging in? Recommended.
vnc_bashrc_startup: true

### Ansible will create certain scripts such as ~/.config/systemd/user/vncserver.service and ~/vncstart.sh
### The question is should Ansible overwrite them later on? Set this to True or False.
vnc_ansible_managed_startup_scripts: false

### Ansible will create xstartup. The question is should Ansible overwrite xstartup files later on? Set this to True or False.
vnc_ansible_managed_xstartup: false

### Ansible will create .vnc/config. The question is should Ansible overwrite .vnc/config later on? Set this to True or False.
vnc_ansible_managed_config: false

### It has been discovered that an Ubuntu server, in the Cloud, ought to be rebooted at least one time in order to fix the locale settings.
### If you set this to True, then Ansible will reboot the server. The default here is False, so you will need to reboot manually.
### Only affected the older per-user systemd configurations.
vnc_reboot_once: false

### An internal role variable called vnc_paradigm refers to which sort of vnc server you are installing.
### version1: everything before the year 2020. Start vnc with the vncserver command.
### version2: tigervnc 1.11.0 and later. Runs vnc as a systemd service.
### You can override/set the variable with vnc_paradigm_override to "version1" or "version2". However, it should be automatically determined so you don't need to change this.
# vnc_paradigm_override: version1

### Optionally create groups and users. By default 'false'
vnc_create_users: false
