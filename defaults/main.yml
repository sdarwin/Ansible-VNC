###You should configure vnc_users for your list of users. Give each a different vnc_num.

#vnc_users:
#  - username: 'ubuntu'
#    usergroup: 'ubuntu'     # usergroup is optional. Defaults to username.
#    #port 5901 is 1
#    vnc_num: 1
#    vnc_default_password: mypassword
#  - username: 'john'
#    #port 5902 is 2
#    vnc_num: 2
#    vnc_default_password: mypassword
#    vnc_client_options_per_user: "-localhost"
#  - username: 'paul'
#    #port 5903 is 3
#    vnc_num: 3
#    vnc_default_password: mypassword
#  - username: 'george'
#    #port 5904 is 4
#    vnc_num: 4
#    vnc_default_password: mypassword
#  - username: 'ringo'
#    #port 5905 is 5
#    vnc_num: 5
#    vnc_default_password: mypassword

###Choices are "gnome" and "xfce4"
vnc_desktop: gnome
#vnc_desktop: xfce4

###Choices of vnc_server for Ubuntu/Debian are currently "tigervnc", "vnc4server" and "tightvnc".
###For Redhat/CentOS, only "tigervnc".
###Some default choices have already been set in the vars/ folder

#vnc_server: tigervnc

vnc_client_options: "-geometry 1280x720 -localhost"

###Should the role generate and enable per-user systemd services for VNC desktops?
vnc_install_systemd_services: False

###Ansible will create certain scripts such as ~/.config/systemd/user/vncserver.service and ~/vncstart.sh
###The question is should Ansible overwrite them later on? Set this to True or False.
vnc_ansible_managed_startup_scripts: False

###Ansible will create xstartup. The question is should Ansible overwrite xstartup files later on? Set this to True or False.
vnc_ansible_managed_xstartup: False

###It has been discovered that an Ubuntu server, in the Cloud, ought to be rebooted at least one time in order to fix the locale settings.
###If you set this to True, then Ansible will reboot the server. The default here is False, so you will need to reboot manually.
###Only affects the systemd type configuration, otherwise not relevant.
vnc_reboot_once: False
